    "> __Time series are observations that have been recorded in an orderly fashion and which are correlated in time.__\n",
    "\n",
    "while analyzing time series data, many data analysts have to make sure of the outliers, much as we do in static data. \n",
    "We may know how much pain outliers cause for us. These outliers are called \"anomalies\" in time series jargon. \n",
    "\n",
    "## What are anomalities/outliers and types of anomalies in time-series data?\n",
    "\n",
    "From a traditional point of view, an outlier/anomaly is : \n",
    "\n",
    "__\"An observation which deviates so much from other obsercations as to arouse suspicions that it was generated by a different mechanism\"__\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, we must think of outliers as observations that don't follow the expected behavior. \n",

    "<img title =\"outliers meaning \" src = \"./images/img1.png\" width =\"600\">\n",
    "\n",
    "As the figure above shows, outliers in time series can have two different meanings. The semantic distinction between them is mainly based on analysts' interest or the particular scenario. \n",
    "\n",
    "These observations have been related to noise, erroneous or unwanted data, which by itself isn't interesting to the analyst. In these cases, outliers should be deleted or corrected to improve data quality, and generate a cleaner dataset that can be used by other data mining algorithms."
